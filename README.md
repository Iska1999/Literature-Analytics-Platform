# Literature-Analytics-Platform

This project investigates whether **scientific literature trends** can help **predict short-term stock price movements** in specific market sectors.

Using data from **arXiv** and **Yahoo Finance**, we process and model monthly metrics with (a) **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** and (b) **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS)** frameworks to explore interactions between scientific literature trends and short-term stock price movements.

## Installation

Follow the steps of Option 1 if interested in only seeing the interactive web application based on the features already uploaded to the SQL server. Follow the steps of Option 2 if interested in collecting, processing, and uploading the features.

### Option 1: Docker Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iska1999/Literature-Analytics-Platform.git
   cd Literature-Analytics-Platform
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker**
   ```bash
   docker build -t lit_platform .
   docker run -p 8501:8501 lit_platform
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Clone and navigate to the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iska1999/Literature-Analytics-Platform.git
   cd Literature-Analytics-Platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run data collection (optional - sample data provided)**
   ```bash
   python data_collection/metadata/metadata_collection.py
   python data_collection/marketdata/marketdata_collection.py
   ```

4. **Process the data**
   ```bash
   python processing/metadata_processing.py
   ```

5. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select Analysis Type**: Choose from the sidebar:
   - Field Trend VAR Analysis
   - Field Trend BSTS Analysis
   - Topic Trend VAR Analysis
   - Topic Trend BSTS Analysis

2. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Feature Type: Raw, Monthly % Change, Rolling Average, or Growth Rate
   - Scientific Field: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Economics, Electrical Engineering & Systems Science, and Quantitative Biology
   - Market Sector: Technology, Healthcare, Financials, Energy, or Industrials

3. **Run Analysis**: Click the "üîç Run Analysis" button to generate results

4. **View Results**: Interactive charts and statistical outputs will be displayed

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The platform uses the following main tables:

- `monthly_metadata`: Aggregated monthly metrics by scientific field
- `rolling_metadata`: Rolling averages for smoothed trends (period = 6 months)
- `monthly_topic`: LDA topic distributions by month
- `rolling_topic`: Smoothed topic trends (period = 6 months)
- `topic_words`: Top words for each LDA topic
- `marketdata`: ETF prices and percentage changes

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Collect more data
- [ ] Analyze using LSTM and CNNs (assuming more data is obtained)
- [ ] Expand to additional data sources (PubMed, Wiley etc.)
- [ ] Implement user authentication and personalization
- [ ] Implement rolling forecast
- [ ] Fine-tune LDA and BSTS models
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for model comparison

## Memory Issues

The arXiv metadata scraping and LDA model training can be time-consuming (around 17 hours) and memory-intensive. Consider reducing the dataset size or using a machine with more RAM.

## Disclaimer

This project was undertaken as part of a technical assessment. As a result, several significant improvements (i.e., model finetuning, different forecasting methods, more data) are yet to be made. Do NOT use this platform as a financials or trading advisor.
